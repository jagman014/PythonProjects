Module 2: Managing Third-Party Dependencies with PIP
----------------------------------------------------
>> 2.1: Intro
> Dependencies
	> 3rd party libraries and frameworks
	> Transitive
		> dependencies of dependencies
	> difficult to manage manually
	> Solution
		> Package managers

>> 2.2: pip: Python package manager
> Packages
	> bundle of software to install python 
	  environment
> pip
	> main interface in command line
	> version check
		> c:\>pip --version
	> help
		> c:\>pip --help

>> 2.3: Installing and updating pip
> Installing
	> should be installed with 3.4+
	> add to existing
		> c:\>python get-pip.py
> Updating
	> c:\>pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

>> 2.4: Package repositories
> PyPI
	> largest official repository of packages
		> search for packages
		> packages not QA tested
			> best to research package
		> each package has its own page
			> shows secondary dependacies
> Can search with c:\>pip search name
	> not as much information

>> 2.5: Python warehouse sneak peek
> Warehouse
	> replaced PyPI
	> updated interface
	> updated search results

>> 2.6: Installing packages with pip
> Installing
	> c:\>pip install [name]
		> installs from PyPI
		> cached locally to speed up repeats
		> installs latest
	> c:\>pip install [name]==[version number]
		> exact version number
	> c:\>pip install [name]>=[number],<[number]
		> version number within range
	> c:\>pip install [name]~=[version number]
		> compatible version
	> c:\>pip install git+[repo link]@branch
		> install from non-PyPI source
		> @master for latest
		> commit hash / tag / release
> Commands
	> c:\>pip list
		> shows a list of dependencies in
		  environment
	> c:\>pip show [name]
		> show metadata of package
> Installing globally
	> default install is global
		> ok if intentional
	> better to set-up virtual environments

>> 2.7: Identifying and updating outdated packages
> Outdated command
	> c:\>pip list --outdated
> Updating command
	> c:\>pip install --upgrade [name]
	> c:\>pip install -U [name]

>> 2.8: Uninstalling packages
> Uninstalling
	> c:\>pip uninstall [name]
		> won't uninstall secondary
		  deoendencies
> Better to use virtual environments
	> delete and recreate environment
